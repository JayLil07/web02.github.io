            <p>You can keep your pet in the daycare for any amount of time between 8am and 6pm. For an additional price, 
                accomodations can be made if your pet must be cared for outside of those hours. If you fail to recieve

            <h4>What If My Pet Doesn't Like Other Animals?</h4>
            <p>Pets are automatically seperated by animal type when placed in the daycare. There are a limited amount of 
                private rooms for pets who do not get along with other animals, but if possible, they would be grouped with 
                their animal type. Please contact us for more information about private rooms, their availability, 
                and if your pet is eligible to be in a private room.</p>

            <h4>What Is Your Vaccination Policy?</h4>
            <p>For our grooming services, we require at the very least proof of vaccination for rabies for cats and dogs. 
                For our daycare services, we require your pet be up to date with all their vaccinations with proof. 
                For this reason, we don't accept animals under 6 months old.</p>
