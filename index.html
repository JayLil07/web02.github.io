                    <h3>What We Do</h3>
                    <p>Here at Puppy Spa & Play, we offer joint grooming and daycare services for those who cannot always take care for their pet 
                        in the way they need, whether that be because of age, physical disability, a busy schedule, or a lack of resources. 
                        The staff at Puppy Spa & Play are determined to give each pet the love they deserve, and do not discriminate against breed, 
                        age, or background. Our clients can rely on us for reliable pet care during the workday and for their pets to leave with 
                        softer fur than they came in with!</p>
